      "contents": "\r\nPossible Issues from R-Squared\r\nR-Squared does a poor job of measure fit. Even when a model is completely correct, it can still be a relativity low fit. Alternatively when a model is incorrect, R-Squared could be still be very close to 1.\r\nTime to blow RSquared up1 💥\r\nR-squared is a statistic that often accompanies regression output. It ranges in value from 0 to 1 and is usually interpreted as summarizing the percent of variation in the response that the regression model explains. So an R-squared of 0.65 might mean that the model explains about 65% of the variation in our dependent variable. Given this logic, we prefer our regression models have a high R-squared.\r\nIn R, we typically get R-squared by calling the summary function on a model object. Here’s a quick example using simulated data:\r\n\r\n\r\n# independent variable\r\nx <- 1:20 \r\n# for reproducibility\r\nset.seed(1) \r\n# dependent variable; function of x with random error\r\ny <- 2 + 0.5*x + rnorm(20,0,3) \r\n# simple linear regression\r\nmod <- lm(y~x)\r\n# request just the r-squared value\r\nsummary(mod)$r.squared          \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] 0.6026682\r\n\r\nOne way to express R-squared is as the sum of squared fitted-value deviations divided by the sum of squared original-value deviations:\r\n\\[\r\nR^{2} =  \\frac{\\sum (\\hat{y} – \\bar{\\hat{y}})^{2}}{\\sum (y – \\bar{y})^{2}}\r\n\\]\r\nWe can calculate it directly using our model object like so:\r\n\r\n\r\n# extract fitted (or predicted) values from model\r\nf <- mod$fitted.values\r\n# sum of squared fitted-value deviations\r\nmss <- sum((f - mean(f))^2)\r\n# sum of squared original-value deviations\r\ntss <- sum((y - mean(y))^2)\r\n# r-squared\r\nmss/tss                      \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] 0.6026682\r\n\r\nR-squared does not measure goodness of fit. It can be arbitrarily low when the model is completely correct. By making\\(σ^2\\) large, we drive R-squared towards 0, even when every assumption of the simple linear regression model is correct in every particular.\r\nWhat is \\(σ^2\\)? When we perform linear regression, we assume our model almost predicts our dependent variable. The difference between “almost” and “exact” is assumed to be a draw from a Normal distribution with mean 0 and some variance we call \\(σ^2\\).\r\nThis statement is easy enough to demonstrate. The way we do it here is to create a function that (1) generates data meeting the assumptions of simple linear regression (independent observations, normally distributed errors with constant variance), (2) fits a simple linear model to the data, and (3) reports the R-squared. Notice the only parameter for sake of simplicity is sigma. We then “apply” this function to a series of increasing \\(σ\\) values and plot the results.\r\n\r\n\r\nr2.0 <- function(sig){\r\n  # our predictor\r\n  x <- seq(1,10,length.out = 100)   \r\n  # our response; a function of x plus some random noise\r\n  y <- 2 + 1.2*x + rnorm(100,0,sd = sig) \r\n  # print the R-squared value\r\n  summary(lm(y ~ x))$r.squared          \r\n}\r\nsigmas <- seq(0.5,20,length.out = 20)\r\n # apply our function to a series of sigma values\r\nrout <- sapply(sigmas, r2.0)            \r\nplot(rout ~ sigmas, type=\"b\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nR-squared tanks hard with increasing sigma, even though the model is completely correct in every respect.\r\nR-squared can be arbitrarily close to 1 when the model is totally wrong.\r\nThe point being made is that R-squared does not measure goodness of fit.\r\n\r\n\r\nset.seed(1)\r\n# our predictor is data from an exponential distribution\r\nx <- rexp(50,rate=0.005)\r\n# non-linear data generation\r\ny <- (x-1)^2 * runif(50, min=0.8, max=1.2) \r\n# clearly non-linear\r\nplot(x,y)             \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsummary(lm(y ~ x))$r.squared\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] 0.8485146\r\n\r\nIt’s very high at about 0.85, but the model is completely wrong. Using R-squared to justify the “goodness” of our model in this instance would be a mistake. Hopefully one would plot the data first and recognize that a simple linear regression in this case would be inappropriate.\r\nPossible Solutions\r\nMean Square Error (MSE) is much more effective when used to measure prediciton error\r\n\r\nhttps://data.library.virginia.edu/is-r-squared-useless/↩︎\r\n",
